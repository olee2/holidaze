Exam 2 - Noroff
[Live Site](https://holidaze-noroff.netlify.app/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is my second and final exam for the Front end development studies at Noroff.

Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking site, has approached me to develop a brand new front end for their application. They have provided a list of required features, but the design and user experience details are open-ended. My task is to work with the official API documentation and create a modern front end for their accommodation booking application.

There are two main aspects to this project. Firstly, the customer-facing side of the website where users can easily book holidays at various venues. Secondly, the admin-facing side of the website where users can register, manage venues, and handle bookings for those venues.
